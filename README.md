## 📂 Contents

This repository contains a full database design project completed for the COMP23111 module. The project includes:

- 📌 **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)** – in UNF and 3NF
- 📌 **Normalization Report** – UNF → 1NF → 2NF → 3NF
- 📌 **Relational Schema** – all tables with PK/FK definitions and constraints
- 📌 **Analysis Reports** – explanation of design decisions and normalization choices

---

## 📊 ERD

- Shows entity relationships before and after normalization
- Uses bridging entities to resolve many-to-many relationships
- Highlights weak entities and composite keys

---

## 🧪 Normalization

- Analyzes initial UNF relations
- Demonstrates conversion to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF
- Identifies and removes partial and transitive dependencies
- Supports design with detailed justifications and new entity introductions

---

## 🗃️ Relational Schema

- Fully normalized schema in 3NF
- Includes:
  - Primary and foreign keys
  - Data types (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`)
  - ON DELETE / ON UPDATE actions
- Discusses decisions such as use of cascading updates or deletions
